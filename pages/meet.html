            <p>I’m Bec, Head Baker of <span>Baked by Bec</span>. I am located in West Point, Iowa. If you’ve never heard of that, it’s just a small drive-thru town in the middle of nowhere 😂 Seriously though, the community is amazing! Probably some of the nicest people you’ll meet live here.</p>
            <p><span>Baked by Bec</span> started a little over a year ago officially. I began by giving away cookies for free to family and friends but I really hadn't thought of turning this hobby into a business until my good friend Elise encouraged me.  So, Elise, this goes out to you.🥂</p> 
            <p><span>Baked by Bec</span> specializes in custom sugar cookies, for every occasion! I’ve done birthday parties, graduations, retirements, work parties, and just-because events! There’s really no end to the list of reasons you need cookies 😂</p>
            <p>When I’m not baking, I’m spending my days teaching some of the most amazing kids! I spend my evenings with my own two daughters , soaking up every fleeting moment with them ♥️</p>
            <p>Thanks for sticking around till the end, and I look forward to baking for all of you soon!!</p>
